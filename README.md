Efficient Meeting Summarization System: Develop a system capable of 
automatically summarizing audio recordings of meetings to extract key points 
and generate concise summaries. The system should employ speech recognition 
techniques to transcribe audio to text accurately, utilize natural language 
processing for text summarization and title generation, and integrate a 
conversational AI module to provide answers to queries related to the meeting 
content. The objective is to streamline the process of extracting actionable 
insights from meetings and enhance productivity.
